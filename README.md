this is a simple aimbot project for CS2, based on the Swed64 project, with a few extra features like smoothing and a (basic) FOV visualizer.
important: Don't use this without launching CS2 with the -insecure flag â€” using it otherwise will almost certainly result in a VAC ban.

This project was created purely for educational purposes. I do not support cheating in online games. My goal is to explore and learn from game engine behavior and vulnerabilities.
